## üì¶ **Installation**

### **Prerequisites**
- **Java 17+** (for Spring Boot backend)
- **Node.js 18+** and **npm** (for Next.js frontend)
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL** (or any JPA-supported database)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

### **Steps**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shivakrishnareddyburra/educational-task-management.git
cd educational-task-management
```

2. **Backend Setup**:
   - Navigate to the backend directory (assumed as `backend/taskmanagement`):
```bash
cd backend/taskmanagement
```
   - Configure the database in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:
```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/taskmanagement_db
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
```
   - Install dependencies and run the Spring Boot application:
```bash
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```
   - The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

3. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Navigate to the frontend directory (assumed as `frontend`):
```bash
cd ../../frontend
```
   - Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
   - Create a `.env.local` file to set the backend API URL:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
```
   - Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
   - The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üö¶ **Usage**

### **Initial Setup**
1. **Database Initialization**:
   - Ensure the database is running and configured.
   - The backend will create tables automatically (`spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update`).

2. **Sign Up / Log In**:
   - Register as a tutor or student via the frontend (assuming an auth endpoint exists; if not, seed users manually in the DB).
   - Example credentials (seed manually if no signup endpoint):
     - **Tutor**: `email: "john@example.com"`, `password: "password123"`, `role: "TUTOR"`
     - **Student**: `email: "jane@example.com"`, `password: "password123"`, `role: "STUDENT"`

### **For Tutors**
1. **Task Management**:
   - Navigate to `/tasks`.
   - Create tasks by specifying title, description, subject, deadline, and assignees.
   - Assign tasks to students and monitor progress via the task list.
2. **Statistics**:
   - Go to `/statistics` to view completion rates, subject performance, grade distribution, and submission timelines.
   - Filter by student, subject, or time period (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly).
3. **Calendar**:
   - Visit `/calendar` to see task deadlines on a monthly grid.
   - Use navigation buttons to switch months and view upcoming events.
4. **Settings**:
   - Access `/settings` to update name, email, username, password, and notification preferences.

### **For Students**
1. **Task Management**:
   - Navigate to `/tasks` to view assigned tasks.
   - Submit progress updates (e.g., percentage complete) for each task.
   - Track status (Pending, In Progress, Completed) on the dashboard.
2. **Calendar**:
   - Check `/calendar` for upcoming deadlines and events.
   - Review tasks due within the next 30 days in the sidebar.
3. **Settings**:
   - Go to `/settings` to edit personal details and toggle notification preferences.
